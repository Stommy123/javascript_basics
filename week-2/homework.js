/** Large data (easy)
* Often times when you're fetching data from a database or API
* It'll come back as a very large array of objects
* You have to get comfortable with looping through and getting what you want
* Using a ForEach loop, go through the array and print only the `trackName`
* Follow this link then copy and paste the giant array into your code editor or repl
* Under it write your loop

/** FizzBuzz (medium)
* Write a For Loop that counts from 1-100
* If the number is a multiple of 3, instead of outputting the number, you'll output the word 'Fizz'
* If the number if a multiple of 5, instead of outputting the number, you'll output the word 'Buzz'
* And if the number is a multiple of both 3 AND 5, then instead of the number you'll output the word 'FizzBuzz'
* If the number is not a multiple of either or both, then output just the number
*/

/** Max Number (hard)
* Write a function called maxNumber, this function should take one argument
* Assume you'll be passing this function an array as its argument
* In this function, you should loop through your array and find the largest number
* Once you've found the largest number, return it to the function
* Feel free to use any loop you want, but my favorite for this is reduce()
*/

/**
* Gradepoint Average (very hard) **BONUS
* Write a function called GPA, this function should take one argument
* Assume the argument will always be an array
* Inside the function, loop through this two dimensional array and return the average of each nested array
* You may only use map() and reduce()
* Hint: You'll need a loop inside a loop
